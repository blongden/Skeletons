# Usage

Add the bin to your $PATH directory:

    export PATH=$PATH:Skeletons/bin

There are scripts in the bin directory that will set up the current directory with your chosen skeleton, i.e. 'silex'.

Hack away!

Enjoy.

# Requirements

The script(s) make use of the jq command to edit composer.json files. If you're using Homebrew you can install it with

    brew install jq

I am quite sure there are many other ways of installing jq :-)
